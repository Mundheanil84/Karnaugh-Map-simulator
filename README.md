# Karnaugh Map Simulator

## Overview
This project is a **Karnaugh Map (K-map) Simulator** designed to simplify Boolean expressions using a visual and interactive approach. Developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the simulator allows users to input Boolean expressions, generate K-maps, and obtain simplified Boolean expressions. The tool is thoroughly tested and proven to be accurate and efficient, making it a valuable resource for engineers and designers working on digital logic circuits.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Interface**: Users can input Boolean expressions and visualize the corresponding K-map.
- **Simplification Algorithm**: Implements the **Quine-McCluskey algorithm** to simplify Boolean expressions.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Displays K-map structures, truth tables, and optimized Boolean expressions in real-time.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Intuitive UI with buttons, input fields, and clear visual representations.

## Innovative Content
The Karnaugh Map (K-map) technique, introduced in this project, is a cornerstone of digital circuit design. It simplifies complex Boolean expressions efficiently, reducing the complexity of digital logic circuits. This simulator modernizes the traditional K-map method by providing a **virtual, interactive tool** for engineers and students.

## Development Process
1. **Frontend Development**: 
   - Built using **HTML** for structure, **CSS** for styling, and **JavaScript** for functionality.
   - Includes interactive elements like buttons, input fields, and dynamic displays for K-maps and truth tables.
   
2. **Algorithm Implementation**:
   - The **Quine-McCluskey algorithm** is used to simplify Boolean expressions.
   - Event listeners detect user input and update the K-map and expression display dynamically.

3. **Visual Representation**:
   - The simulator dynamically generates K-maps based on user input.
   - Highlights cells with values (1, 0, or 'x') and displays the simplified Boolean expression.

## Applications
- **Educational Tool**: Helps students and educators understand Boolean algebra and K-map simplification.
- **Engineering Design**: Assists engineers in simplifying digital logic circuits for efficient design and implementation.
