# Karnaugh-Map-simulator
Abstract— 
This research paper proposes the design and 
development of a simulator to simplify Boolean expressions 
using Karnaugh Map (K-map). The simulator is developed 
using Html, CSS and JavaScript allows users to input Boolean 
expressions, display Karnaugh Map and output simplified 
Boolean expressions. The simulator is tested thoroughly and 
found to be accurate and efficient in simplifying Boolean 
expressions. The proposed simulator provides an effective tool 
for engineers and designers to simplify Boolean expressions, 
ultimately reducing the complexity of digital logic circuits.

INNOVATIVE CONTENT
K-map, have been widely used in digital circuit design for 
decades. In this paper, Karnaugh map introduced a method for 
simplifying Boolean expressions using a two-dimensional 
map. The innovative content of Karnaugh's paper lies in the 
simplicity and effectiveness of the K-map technique, which 
allowed engineers to simplify complex digital circuits more 
efficiently than previous methods. Karnaugh's paper remains 
a cornerstone of digital circuit design, and K-map continue to 
be used today.
